# Web Calc Calculator

This app was created as an assignment.

The app was bootstrapped using the example from `pnpm create next-app --example with-passport`.

It is deployed to Vercel at https://web-calc-app.vercel.app/

To run it locally, you need to set up a .env file with the values in .env.example - it requires a Postgres DB connection, and you may also need to generate the Prisma client and apply migrations. You can run it locally using `pnpm run dev`
